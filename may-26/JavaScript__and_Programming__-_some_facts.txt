1. The JS Programming World has
different types of objects
	- objects have properties (talked about)
	- objects have methods (talked about)
	- objects have events (talk later)
	- we use dot notation to
2. Prorgams can receive input and output values
	- values are often stored in
	variables (later, properties)
	- variables can store different types of values
	- their values are often
		- used to change what is shown on screen
		- (or maybe the console for debugging)
		- passed on for processing and storage
3. Programs can have _control flow_
	- decisions can be made (if...else if...else)
	- processes can be repeated (loops)
	- processes can grouped into steps to perform a task (functions, methods)
	
4. Developers would often employ patterns of code so that they can all write similarly within the same style.
